Pilgrim3
========

The Pilgrim program is designed to replace or at least supplement the standard Windows Explorer application supplied with MS Windows. The problem with the standard Explorer application is that it requires a separate window to be opened for each folder you wish to “bookmark”. There is no easy way to set bookmarks except my shortcuts which is not really very convenient. Pilgrim provides an MDI version of an explorer interface with enhancements and additions to more easily navigate round the PC.

The reason that it is called Pilgrim is due to the nature of exploring the furthest reaches of your PC looking for inspiration or enlightenment.
